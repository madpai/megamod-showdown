# Halo Trial Android — handoff

**Read this file. You should not need anything else to start.**
`docs/JOURNAL.md` is the session-by-session history — go there only when you
want the *why* behind something, and search it by symptom.

**Date of this revision:** 2026-09-21
**Repo:** `/home/commander/projects/halo-trial-android`

---

## What this is

A clean-room native ARM64 Android engine that reads the owner's own legally
obtained **Halo: Combat Evolved Trial** data and plays Blood Gulch. C, Vulkan,
AAudio, no engine dependencies. Every number it can get from a tag, it gets
from a tag.

**Hard constraints — do not break these:**

- **No Halo assets, executables or DLLs are ever committed or bundled in an
  APK.** The owner supplies their own Trial copy; the app asks for it on first
  run. No DRM is involved or circumvented.
- **Never commit Trial `.map` files.** They live outside the repo at
  `/home/commander/halo-trial-data/extract/maps/`.
- Project code is **GPLv3**.
- Git author on this repo is **`Phase2 <schultz0@proton.me>`**.
- **Do not push unless asked.**

---

## The loop

This working rhythm is the owner's, it is good, and it should be kept.

### 1. Change something, then verify

```
cd /home/commander/projects/halo-trial-android
HTA_MAP=/home/commander/halo-trial-data/extract/maps/bloodgulch.map scripts/verify.sh
```

52 checks: host build, every unit test twice (synthetic, then against the real
map), a synthetic-fixture CLI pass, an offscreen render, the APK build, and the
APK's contents (arm64 only, no bundled audio, right entry points).

**`verify.sh` must be green before you publish.** If you add a module, add its
test to `CMakeLists.txt` *and* to both halves of `verify.sh`.

Note: `src/platform/platform_android.c` is **only** compiled by the Android
target. `cmake --build build-host` will not catch a mistake in it — only
`verify.sh` (via `gradle assembleDebug`) will.

### 2. Publish to the sideload server

```
scripts/publish_apk.sh --title "what changed" --notes-text "a sentence or two"
```

Builds the APK, copies it to the serve root, refreshes `SHA256SUMS`, stamps the
page with the commit and build time, and starts the server if it is not up.
The owner then installs from **http://100.89.1.14:8731** (Tailscale-bound).

- `--notes` takes an HTML fragment; `--notes-text` takes one paragraph.
- `--no-build` publishes whatever is already built.
- The page is a committed template at `scripts/sideload/index.html.tmpl` —
  edit **that**, not the generated `scratch/serve/index.html`.
- The serve root is `scratch/serve/` (gitignored, so maps and APKs never enter
  git). It must **not** live in a session scratchpad under `/tmp`: that
  directory dies with the session and the page then advertises a build from
  hours earlier while claiming to be current. If `publish_apk.sh` warns that a
  server is running with a different root, kill it and rerun.

**Write real release notes.** The owner reads them, and they are how a change
gets tested deliberately rather than stumbled into.

### 3. The owner tests on device and sends screenshots

Screenshots uploaded from the phone land in `scratch/serve/uploads/` and are
mirrored to `scratch/uploads/`. List them newest-first:

```
ls -lt scratch/uploads/ | head
```

Then read them directly — they carry the HUD readout (position, ground/air,
**fps**) which is often the whole diagnosis. The 120 fps idle reading is what
proved the particle-lag was CPU raycasts and not fill.

### 4. Say what to look at next

End a session by naming the **current testing objective** — what specifically
to try on device and what a failure would look like. Keep it in this file, in
the section below, and update it every time.

---

## CURRENT TESTING OBJECTIVE

> **Build `0444970` — "The flinch was an overlay".**
>
> 1. Shoot the body standing in front of the spawn. It should **flinch and
>    stay upright** — feet on the ground, right way up. That was the bug.
> 2. Try each weapon on him via the **DBG** pad (left edge, cycles the whole
>    roster). The damage model is per-material now: the **shotgun** should feel
>    weak against his shield and strong once it is down; the **plasma rifle**
>    the other way round; the **sniper** should be two shots; **melee kills
>    outright**, which is what his tag says.
> 3. Grenades and rockets should hurt him by blast radius.
>
> Known and deliberate: he does not move, aim or shoot. No hit *sound* yet.

## Where things stand

### Working, confirmed on device

Blood Gulch renders with lightmaps, detail maps, sky and glass; scenery and
vehicles are placed and collidable. First-person movement on the Trial's own
biped physics — run, crouch, jump, slopes, headroom, fall damage.

**Weapons.** All eleven playable, with real first-person models, hands from
`globals`, and their own animation graphs: ready, idle, fire, reload (shotgun
shell-at-a-time chaining included), melee, and `throw-grenade`. Muzzle flashes
from the firing effect's own particle. Spent brass from the ejection marker.
Per-weapon zoom with the sniper's scope furniture. On-gun round counters drawn
with the HUD font.

**HUD.** Crosshair, shield and health meters, ammo pips, the rounds counter,
scope overlays, and a full-screen fade.

**Sound.** Positional and panned, the weapon's own firing sounds, footsteps by
material, impacts by material, the flamethrower's looping roar, the shield's
five HUD sounds (recharge hum, hit, low, depleted, heartbeat), and the Chief's
death lines.

**Combat.** Hitscan and object projectiles, per-material impact effects and
decals, particles with the tags' own physics and colours, grenades, rockets
that explode properly, health and shields with recharge.

**Dying.** Full sequence: death line, the camera leaves your head and watches
your body go down with one of Halo's kill animations, five seconds, respawn at
a spawn point away from where you died.

**Items.** Blood Gulch's own 37 placements with real respawn timers and
weighted choices. Two-weapon carry, the map's own AR+pistol loadout, SWAP to
switch or to pick up.

**A body to shoot at.** Stands in front of the spawn with the player's health,
shield and collision shape, holds a rifle, flinches, dies, comes back.

### Not started

- **Vehicles.** The Warthog is drawn and collidable but not drivable. This is
  the biggest single piece left and the biggest jump in how the game feels.
- **Bots.** The body exists; it needs somewhere to walk, something to walk
  towards, an eye test and a trigger. None of that touches what is there.
- **Netcode.** Parked deliberately.
- **Menus.** `ui.map` holds the entire Halo shell as 811 `DeLa` widget
  definitions, 168 string lists, 6 fonts, 222 bitmaps, a virtual keyboard and
  a map list. A faithful main menu is a widget-tree interpreter, not asset
  work.
- **The announcer.** All 39 multiplayer lines are in `bloodgulch.map` already
  (`sound\dialog\multiplayer1\*`): slayer, CTF, double kill, killtacular,
  game over. They need a game mode to mean anything.
- **Music.** There is none in Blood Gulch, and that is correct — Halo CE
  multiplayer maps carry no score. The campaign map has it.

### Known gaps worth fixing

| | |
|---|---|
| Dropped weapons | A weapon you swap off vanishes. Drawing one needs a second dynamic mesh holding each weapon model once. `HTA_GFX_MAX_DYNAMIC` was raised to 8 to leave room — six were already in use. |
| Items do not rotate | Halo spins powerups. Doing it means paying the full item upload every frame or splitting powerups into their own dynamic mesh. The latter. |
| Camouflage does nothing | It runs its timer. Nothing to hide from yet. |
| No mipmaps on dynamic meshes | The chain is gated on `vslots == 0`. Bodies and items shimmer at distance. |
| Picked-up weapons are full | `hta_ammo_init` runs on equip; a dropped weapon should carry what was left in it. |
| Motion tracker | Art and behaviour readable (`unhi` 620/724, `hud_globals` range and scale) but placement is not in the tag, and nothing moves to track. Deferred three times. |
| No hit sound on the body | `weapons\*\effects\impact cyborg shield` is in the cache and is the right thing to reach for. |
| The bot's rifle is hardcoded | Should be whatever it is carrying, once it carries anything. |

## How to read Halo's tags

This is the part that makes or breaks a session.

**1. Struct sizes must reconcile.** Walk a struct's fields in
`upstream/invader/src/tag/hek/definition/*.json`, add up the sizes, and check
the total against the declared `size`. If it matches, every offset before it is
trustworthy. If it does not, the walk drifted and you must probe instead.

**2. `"bounds": true` counts as TWO values.** Missing that is what put every
`Weapon` offset past `zoom magnification range` in the wrong place.
`"count": N` multiplies.

**3. Probe when the walk drifts.** Write a throwaway C program against
`libhta_engine.a`, scan the tag data for a dependency whose class is what you
expect, and print the offset. `Projectile`'s `impact damage` at **+548** and
`UnitHUDInterface`'s sounds at **+960** were both found this way, and both
disagree with a naive walk.

**4. Sanity-check the values against the world.** A number that reconciles can
still be the wrong field. The spent-casing radii were checked against real
cartridge sizes (9 mm, 7.62×51, 12-gauge, .50 BMG) and that is what revealed
every particle was being drawn at twice its tagged size.

**5. Velocities in Halo tags are per TICK (30/s).** Projectile initial and
final velocity, falling-damage velocities. Ranges and timers are not.

**6. One world unit is 3.048 m** (ten feet). The standing eye is 0.62 wu.
Comments in this codebase sometimes say "12.5 cm" where they mean 0.125 wu —
do not trust a unit in a comment, check the constant.

### Offsets found by probing (the walk drifts to reach them)

| what | where |
|---|---|
| Projectile `impact damage` | **proj+548** (needler has none; scan for any damaging `jpt!`) |
| Projectile detonation responses | proj+576, 160 each, kind at +2 (reflect == 2) |
| Projectile `detonation timer starts` | proj+384 |
| UnitHUDInterface sounds | **unhi+960**, 56 each, `latched to` at +16 |
| `unhi` motion sensor background / foreground | 620 / 724 |
| ParticleSystem particle types | pctl+92, 128 each |
| — type radius / states / particle states | +44 / +104 (192 each) / +116 (376 each) |
| — state rate / duration | state+88 / state+32 |
| — pstate bitmap / radius mult / blend / colours | +48 / +128 / +226 / +96 and +112 |
| Equipment powerup type / grenade type / time / pickup sound | 776 / 778 / 780 / 784 |
| DamageEffect per-material multipliers | **jpt+512**, one float per MaterialType |
| Unit `melee damage` | 380 + 268 |
| Object model / animation graph / attachments | +40 / +56 / +320 (72 each) |

**MaterialType 21 is cyborg armour, 22 is cyborg energy shield.** Those two
are how much of a hit a player actually takes.

## Traps that have already cost a session

Each of these bit once and is now defended by a test. Search `JOURNAL.md` for
the full story.

- **Overlay animations (`type 1`) must not be played as ordinary clips.** They
  keyframe a handful of nodes; every other node takes the *animation's own
  defaults*, not the pose underneath. The body turns inside out. Use
  `hta_anim_animates` and compose. This has bitten **twice** — the needler's
  ammunition and the cyborg's flinch. **Check `anims[i].type` before playing
  anything new.**
- **`hta_anim_find` matches a SUBSTRING.** The cyborg has 254 animations and a
  dozen seated ones; plain `"idle"` finds `B-driver unarmed idle`, a body
  sitting in a Banshee, hanging in the air.
- **Fix shading before trusting animation.** The needler was "broken" through
  three animation rewrites; it was a `sgla` shader nothing handled.
- **A texture table must exist before anything interns into it.**
  `hta_model_append_skinned` fills `mesh.textures`, it does not create it.
- **`hta_submesh_init` exists because zero is a valid texture index.** A
  memset left `detail_tex = 0`, which multiplied every model by its own
  texture 0.
- **`add_elem` sets its fields one by one**, so a new field on `hta_hud_elem`
  is garbage on every other element until you initialise it there.
- **A tint alpha of zero means "no tint"** to the HUD draw loop, which then
  falls back to opaque white. A fade of nothing must collapse the quad.
- **Relink probe binaries after `cmake --build`.** A stale probe against the
  old static library gives confident wrong answers. This has recurred.
- **Read one-shot vitals flags BEFORE `hta_vitals_update`**, which clears them.
- **Blast deaths land a frame late** because projectiles update after vitals.
  That is invisible and fine.
- **A corpse must stop no bullets**, or a dead body soaks the magazine meant
  for the next one.
- **Dynamic meshes write one vertex slot per in-flight frame.** Uploading a
  change once leaves stale geometry in the other slots. The count belongs to
  the swapchain, so re-upload for several frames.

## Numbers that are OURS, not the tags'

Every one of these is invented because no tag carries it. If something feels
wrong, this list is the first place to look — they are all one constant.

| constant | value | what it is |
|---|---|---|
| `HTA_HUD_PHONE_SCALE` | 1.75 | HUD size on a phone |
| `HTA_HUD_WEAPON_SCALE` | 0.5 | the weapon block |
| `HTA_SOUND_NEAR` / `_FAR` | 3 / 60 wu | distance attenuation |
| `HTA_GRENADE_THROW` | 9.0 wu/s | throw speed |
| `PROJ_BOUNCE` | 0.35 | projectile restitution |
| `PART_REST_SPEED` | 0.15 wu/s | below this a bounced particle has landed |
| `HTA_PART_AREA` | 120 sq wu | live particle quad budget — **the GPU knob** |
| `HTA_PART_RECUR` | 0.25 s | how often an effect is assumed to recur |
| `HTA_RESPAWN_DELAY` | 5 s | player respawn (gametype value, not in the map) |
| `HTA_DEATH_*` | — | death camera pull-back, fade timings |
| `HTA_VITALS_LOW` | 0.25 | when "low shield"/"low health" sounds start |
| `HTA_OVERSHIELD_MULT` | 3.0 | how much overshield gives (tag says how long only) |
| `HTA_PICKUP_REACH` | 0.5 wu | pickup radius |
| `HTA_PICKUP_LIFT` | 0.06 wu | how far an item floats off its placement |
| `HTA_ITEM_RESPAWN_DEFAULT` | 15 s | when neither placement nor collection says |
| `HTA_MELEE_REACH` | 0.5 wu | how far a swing reaches |
| `HTA_VM_KEY_FRACTION` | 0.35 | when a clip "does its thing" if `key frame` is 0 |
| `HTA_BOT_RESPAWN` | 5 s | how long a body lies there |
| `HTA_ITEMS_UPLOAD_FRAMES` | 8 | ≥ any swapchain image count |

## Tools

```
# look at the first-person view without a device
./build-host/htaview $HTA_MAP --fp idle   --shots 2 --out /tmp/fp
./build-host/htaview $HTA_MAP --weapon "rocket launcher" --fly 0.05

# chase a "stuck here" report: the HUD readout gives x y z
./build-host/htaprobe $HTA_MAP --at 96.57 -155.72 --z 0.81   # why it pushes
./build-host/htaprobe $HTA_MAP --find 0.81 --near 96 -155    # if a digit is unreadable
./build-host/htaview  $HTA_MAP --eye 96.57 -155.72 1.43 --yaw 180

# tags and sounds
./build-host/htainfo  $HTA_MAP
./build-host/htasound $HTA_MAP --dump <tag>
```

`htaprobe --at` prints the whole vertical column, headroom, standing and
crouching push, and every nearby triangle with a verdict. **Probe from the
player's own z** — a ground query from the sky finds the roof. `--eye` takes
the eye position, so add the 0.62 standing eye height to their feet z.

**Writing a throwaway probe** is the normal way to answer a tag question:

```c
cc -O1 -I src probe.c build-host/libhta_engine.a -lm -o probe
```

Put them in the session scratchpad, not the repo. Relink after every rebuild.

## Working notes for the next agent

- **The owner tests every build.** Small, shippable slices beat big ones.
  Publish, say what to look at, and let the next screenshot decide.
- **Say which numbers are invented.** The owner has repeatedly, correctly,
  pushed back on things that felt wrong, and every time the answer was either
  a tag we were not reading or a constant we had made up. Flag them in the
  release notes.
- **When something looks wrong, suspect the data path before the art.** The
  body that "looked ugly" was unlit and unarmed; the model was fine.
- **Measure before optimising.** The particle lag was blamed on fill twice and
  was CPU raycasts both times. The 120 fps idle reading in a screenshot was
  the proof.
- **Write the test that would have caught it.** Every trap above has one.
